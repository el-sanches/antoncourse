          I put up with the fact that I wouldn’t have a normal life like
          everyone else. But one day, I took a projective test
          where I had to describe animals. It turned out that I was
          describing myself, the way I was – that’s how I managed
          to see myself from the outside.

         It felt like a strike of lightning, I began to feel myself, hear
         myself. And the voice inside responded: “Anton, you can
         do more, you can do better”. Thus, I gradually got rid of addictions
         and in 2008 I got involved in psychology.

          In 2014, I became a psychologist, and in 2018 a clinical
          psychologist. Since 2016 I had been helping people, but I didn’t
          resolve the biggest issue – the issue of my health.

        Since the age of 6, I suffered from stammering and at the age of 27 I
        made up my mind to deal with it: I read books, studied various
        techniques, sought professional medical help. At some point, I was
        looking for a psychologist who could help me with this problem, and
        I found not just a psychologist but a specialist in psychosomatics.
